<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at
  parties. My father recommends:<br>
  
      "Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the<br> winter, try serving it warm."

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p> 1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes<br> 2 large garlic cloves<br>2/3 c. kalamata olives<br>1 t. capers</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>1. Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possi-ble.<br> 2. Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some texture.<br>3. Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</p>
