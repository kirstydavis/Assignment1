<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new <br> cooking technique called sous vide. <br> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed <br> in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely <br> set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks,<br> Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature
poaching.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.<br> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before<time datetime="2018-11-30"> November 30 </time></p>

Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
